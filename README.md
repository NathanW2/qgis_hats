Because

> Exec #1: Item six on the agenda: "The Meaning of Life" Now uh, Harry, you've had some thoughts on this.

> Exec #2: Yeah, I've had a team working on this over the past few weeks, and what we've come up with can be reduced to two fundamental concepts. One: People aren't wearing enough hats. Two: Matter is energy. In the universe there are many energy fields which we cannot normally perceive. Some energies have a spiritual source which act upon a person's soul. However, this "soul" does not exist ab initio as orthodox Christianity teaches; it has to be brought into existence by a process of guided self-observation. However, this is rarely achieved owing to man's unique ability to be distracted from spiritual matters by everyday trivia.

> Exec #3: What was that about hats again?

> Exec #2: Oh, Uh... people aren't wearing enough.

> Exec #1: Is this true?

> Exec #4: Certainly. Hat sales have increased but not pari passu, as our research...

> Exec #3: [Interrupting] "Not wearing enough"? enough for what purpose?

> Exec #5: Can I just ask, with reference to your second point, when you say souls don't develop because people become distracted...

## Install

Just install using the plugin installer. Done.  You now get daily/monthly hats for your QGIS logo. 

It's pretty much a win win for you, QGIS, and hats all around the world.

## Adding a new hat?

Create a png file in SoManyHats using the following format:

`{month}-{day}.png`

or just `{month}.png` if it's to conver a full month.

Here is a easy example:

## Adding a new hat? QGIS 3

Add _3 to the end of the file name to make it usable by QGIS 3.

Example:

03_03.png <- QGIS 3 icon
03.png <- QGIS 2 icon
